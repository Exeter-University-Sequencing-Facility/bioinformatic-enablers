## Understanding the Goals of your Experiment

Before you start your analysis it is very important to understand and think about your experimantal goals and what you plan to achieve during your analysis.

Ideally the details of analysis phase has been considered in detail during the design of the experiment. But you will often find that this is not the case! Even so, it is better to start now.

Our simple experiment deals with the motility functions of *Burkholderia pseudomallei* which is the causitive agent of melioidosis. For a quick background try the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkholderia_pseudomallei).

Our experiment deals with the re-acquisistion of function after a key gene kdsD has been knocked-out. Comparing the phenotype of the wildtype strain with the kdsD knock-out shows that the latter suffers from growth defects and loss of motility. After extended incubation several sub-colonies had regained motility to varying degrees. We want to identify the genetic changes involved. 

In our experiment we only have 5 samples.

- wildtype
- original mutant
- reverted mutant 1
- reverted mutant 2
- reverted mutant 3

Our goal is the identify the genetic differences in the 5 isolates.

The approach we will take is described in the Broad Institutes Best Practices
