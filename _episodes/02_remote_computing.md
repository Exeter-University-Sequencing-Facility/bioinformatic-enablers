## Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson you will be understand different ways to connect to a remote computer.

## Remote Computing

Bioinformatic analysis can require huge amounts of computational resource. It is often impractical to use acquire enough resource to install on or under your desk!

For this reason, we usually connect to a larger server (or cluster of servers) in the University's data-centre, or possibly in the cloud.

Data and applications are stored and processed on remote servers. Users can access these resources and perform tasks remotely using various devices, such as computers, smartphones, or tablets, via an internet connection. 

## Command line interface

Much bioinformatic analysis is performed from the command line on a Linux server. But first we need to use a program to connect to the remote server.  
Normally we will connect using ssh (Secure Shell) On a Mac you can use this from the terminal directly, from a Windows based machine you need to install a program.

Common options are:

### MobaXterm

[MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) has a free portable version.

### Termius

[Termius](https://termius.com/) is available as a free application on Microsoft Store

### PuTTy

[PuTTy](https://www.putty.org/) used to be the go to option and is still very popular. I can neither recommend nor ignore it!
