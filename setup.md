To use this workshop you will need some software installed on your computer - these are suggestions, but feel free to use whichever program you prefer. If you use any tools that are not listed here please let us know!

## SSH Terminal Application

You will be connecting to a remote computer (ISCA) via SSH - There are a number of options available see this page on [remote computing](../02_remote_computing)

## File Transfer Utility

You will need a program to download files from ISCA to your computer.
Again there are details to ont the [Exeter RSE course](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-to-isca/04_file_transfer/index.html)  
We recomment the WinSCP option.

## Connecting to ISCA

Make sure you can connect to ISCA using both the terminal sofware you have chosen and the file transfer program.  
You need to know :  

- the full network name - it is `login.isca.ex.ac.uk`  put this wherever the program asks you for 'server', 'address', 'host', or 'remote computer'  
- Your username is your university short name
- And your password is your usual password
