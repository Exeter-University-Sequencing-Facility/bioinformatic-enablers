## Overview

You'll likely be eager to begin running your bioinformatic programs and pipelines, and perhaps even developing your own programs and scripts. However, there will be several challenges to tackle before you can effectively and efficiently utilize the computational environment. This course (or reference) aims to serve as a guide or roadmap, supporting you in code management, data handling, resource utilization, and the efficient execution of bioinformatics tasks.

This course is not intended to add original material, but rather incorporates material from various sources, including the excellent University of Exeter Research Software Engineering Group's resources (available at https://uniexeterrse.github.io/workshop-homepage).


## Objectives

This course will covering the following:

- How to connect to a remote computer.
- Understand and use the Operating System and Shell.
- Editing Files.
- Copying files.
- Compression.
- Programming Languages.
- Versioning.

### UoE specifics

- ISCA (HPC)
- Data Storage

## Pre-requisite knowledge

There are no special pre-requisites for this, rather, elements of this course will be refered to by subsequent courses.

## Workshop format

This is an online course (and reference)


## Feedback

Please remember to complete a feedback survey. Our workshops are under continual review and your experiences, suggestions and criticism are invaluable for shaping the direction of this initiative. This is especially important if you complete the materials in your own time as it enables us to measure impact. If you have ideas on other bioinformatic based courses you would like to see then please contact Paul O'Neill <p.a.oneill@exeter.ac.uk>
